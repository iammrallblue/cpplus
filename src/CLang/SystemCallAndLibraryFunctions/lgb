[Intro: Joe Biden & Bryson Gray]
The various shots the people are getting now cover that
They're-, they're-, they're okay
You're not gonna-, you're not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccinations
Somebody gotta do it
Ayy

[Chorus: Bryson Gray]
Let's go, Brandon
I keep a drum like I'm Nick Cannon, ayy, ayy (Brrt, brrt)
Let's go, Brandon
Pandemic ain't real, they just planned it, ayy, ayy (They just planned it)
Let's go, Brandon
When you ask questions, they start bannin', ayy, ayy (Facts)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go, Brandon)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go, Brandon)
Let's go, Brandon
I keep a drum like I'm Nick Cannon, ayy, ayy (Pow, pow)
Let's go, Brandon
Pandemic ain't real, thеy just planned it, ayy, ayy (They just planned it)
Lеt's go, Brandon
When you ask questions, they start bannin', ayy, ayy (Facts)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Let's go)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go)

[Verse 1: Bryson Gray]
Biden said the jab stop the spread, it was lies (I remember)
How you woke, but you haven't opened your eyes? (You ain't see)
These politicians are demons, just in disguise (Facts)
Look at Kyrie Irving and Nicki Minaj (Let's go)
Look at Australia, that's what's comin' next if we don't stand up
Stop complyin' with them takin' our rights, it's time to man up
'Publicans votin' for red flag laws, that's just what I can't trust
If you ask questions 'bout the vax, then they gonna ban us (It's true)
Ayy, this is 'bout control, everybody knows
Everyone complies weigh the cons and pros
I don't need a plane, I just hit the road
I do what I want, I can't sell my soul
Market 'bout to crash, this is what you chose
Ruinin' the country, I think that's the goal
You gon' take the mark, I take narrow roads
I'm a man of God, I can never fold
[Chorus: Bryson Gray]
Let's go, Brandon
I keep a drum like I'm Nick Cannon, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Brrt, brrt)
Let's go, Brandon
Pandemic ain't real, they just planned it, ayy, ayy (They just planned it)
Let's go, Brandon
When you ask questions, they start bannin', ayy, ayy (Facts)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go, Brandon)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go, Brandon)
Let's go, Brandon
I keep a drum like I'm Nick Cannon, ayy, ayy (Pow, pow)
Let's go, Brandon
Pandemic ain't real, they just planned it, ayy, ayy (They just planned it)
Let's go, Brandon
When you ask questions, they start bannin', ayy, ayy (Facts)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Let's go)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go)

[Verse 2: Tyson James]
Yeah
Let's go, Brandon and it's clear that man a wreck, ayy, ayy
Let's go, Brandon, now the Taliban a threat, ayy
You planned it, now the Taliban is standin' on our neck
Chantin' "Death to America", you are barely president
Listen, I don't think you hear, man, let me make it clear, man
Better keep yo' hands unto yourself, that stuff is weird, man
I wish I could take you in the back play, smear the queer, man
You could take the vax, I fear God, I don't fear man
I'm on gear ten, believe me, we ready to rumble
The only play that Joe can execute is a fumble (Facts)
I think we all know he's out to lunch, that dude went campin'
I'm a Christian, so how do I say this? Let's go, Brandon
[Chorus: Bryson Gray]
Let's go, Brandon
I keep a drum like I'm Nick Cannon, ayy, ayy (Brrt, brrt)
Let's go, Brandon
Pandemic ain't real, they just planned it, ayy, ayy (They just planned it)
Let's go, Brandon
When you ask questions, they start bannin', ayy, ayy (Facts)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go, Brandon)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go, Brandon)

[Verse 3: Chandler Crump]
(Gottem, Ayy, yuh)
Let's go, Brandon, we know he cappin'
Patriots out in the street takin' action
Huntin' us down for speakin' the truth (Huh)
Beat down the pedo, let's save all the youth (Uh huh)
Media lyin', ignore all the cryin'
They buildin' back better, but only the Taliban (What?)
Pilots on strike, but to Joe, it's irrelevant
Open the border, lose all the order
Divide us up so they know that we never win
But we united, we here in the stadiums (Let's go)
Everyone chantin' it, CNN slanderin' (Let's go)
Biden collapsin' and Democrats stealin' it (Facts)
Ayy, we look at Joe, can we get a refund? (Brandon)
How 'bout some mean tweets? (Facts)
Joe is a crook, and he knows how to deceive
F. J. B. is the motto in these streets, let's go, Brandon
Sing it with me
[Chorus: Bryson Gray]
I keep a drum like I'm Nick Cannon, ayy, ayy (Pow, pow)
Let's go, Brandon
Pandemic ain't real, they just planned it, ayy, ayy (They just planned it)
Let's go, Brandon
When you ask questions, they start bannin', ayy, ayy (Facts)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Let's go)
Let's go, Brandon, ayy, ayy (Ayy, let's go)
