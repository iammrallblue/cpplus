/*
    Compound assignment in C++
        1. Compound assignment operators modify the current value of a variable 
            by performing an operation on it.   
        2. They are equivalent to assigning the result of an operation to the first operand

        (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, >>=, <<=, &=, ^=, |=)

        Expression	        Equivalent to...
        y += x;	            y = y + x;
        x -= 5;	            x = x - 5;
        x /= y;	            x = x / y;
        price *= units + 1;	price = price * (units+1);
