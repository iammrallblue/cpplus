    Pointer in C++:
        A POINT TYPE is a compound type representing the address of a memory location. 
        A pointer variable is a variable whose contents are of pointer type

        How to define and use pointer:

        Syntax:
            int * pointerName;
            pointerName = &variable; // 
            or
            int * pointerName = &variable; &variable is the address of the variable.

        Key point:
            Pointer variables contain memory addresses as their values.

            1. &variable means the memory address of the variable.

            2. Addresses:
                1) Addresses in Memory:
                    computer memory is a sequence of bytes,
                    Each byte of memory has an address in hexadecimal format.

                2) Address of variable:
                    as known variable, different types of the variable: Boolean, 
                    character, integer, floating point, and class.

            3. Address (&) Operator
                to get address of variable by using address operator " & ".

            4. Indrection operator " * ".
                commonly referred to as the indirection operator or dereferencing operator

    cout << "Pointer p = " << p << endl; // 0x7ffeecb0f208, which mean pointer p got the variable x's memory address

    // Indirection (Dereference) change value of variable x by pointer *p
    *p = 2333;
    cout << "Changing value of x by *p (dereference), x = " << x << endl;   // value of variable x
