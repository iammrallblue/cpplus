    Vector in C++

        Vector:
            1. Vector is part of C++ Standard Template Library, therefore include it before using it
                #include <vector>
            2. std::vector<T> vector_name;
            3. vectors are used to store similar datatypes, unlike array
                the size of a vector can grow dynamically
            4 *** The size of the vector is changable during the execution of a program as per our requirements.
            5. 
        methods of declaring vector
            method 1:
                // Initializer list
                vector<int> vector1 = {1,2,3,4,5};

                vector<int> vector2 {1,2,3,4,5,6};

            method 2:
                vector<int< vector3(5,12);
