    sequential structure
        In sequential structure, the statements are executed in the same order in which they are specified in the program. 
        The control flows from one statement to another in a logical sequence. 
        We can write as many statements as we want but all statements are executed exactly once. 
        It means that no statement is skipped and no statement is repeated.
